# PolynomialRegression
Polynomial Regression using gradient descent

In this assignment, polynomial regression models of degrees 1,2,3,4,5,6 have been developed for the 3D Road Network (North Jutland, Denmark) Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/3D+Road+Network+(North+Jutland%2C+Denmark)  using gradient descent method. R squared, RMSE and Squared Error values have been calculated and compared for each model to find the models which best fit the data, as well as ones which overfit the data. L1 and L2 regularisation has been implemented to explore the effect of regularisation on testing loss and overfitting.
